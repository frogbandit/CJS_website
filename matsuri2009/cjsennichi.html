<p>Come check out some traditional Japanese festival booths run by our very own CJS members and volunteers!</p>

<li><h4>Japan Info Booth</h4>
<p>Ever wanted to speak to a real Japanese person? What are they like? What kind of fashion are they into?
What kind of movies do they watch? What do they think of American politics? What kind of music do they 
listen to? Why don't you ask yourself? Come to this booth and talk to ordinary Japanese people on ordinary 
issues. They aren't college professors, they're people like you and me. And you're going to get responses 
from people like you or me.</p>

<h4>Calligraphy</h4>
<p>Do you know what your name looks like in Japanese? Would you like to have it written for you 
in real ink and brush? Head over to this booth and get it done for you for free!</p>

<h4>Face Painting</h4>
<p>Get one of our great artists to paint things on your face or perhaps take a chance with a 
guy who has absolutely no art skills! Try painting stuff on your own face if you'd like! Whatever!</p>

<h4>Sumo Wrestling</h4>
<p>Wear inflatable sumo suits and experience what it's like to participate in the most exhilirating 
physical competition in the world!</p>

</li>
<a name="5"></a><li><h4>Kingyo Sukui</h4>
<p>Kingyo Sukui means "goldfish scooping." The game, which started during the Edo period, is very 
simple. Using a paper scoop, try to scoop as many goldfish into your bowl of water as you can! 
But the longer your scoop is in the water, the weaker it becomes...</p>

<h4>Jinja</h4>
<p>Jinja is the Japanese word for a Shinto shrine. Matsuri are traditionally associated with the 
Shinto activity of enshrining a god. Today, traditional matsuri are still held on shrine grounds. 
To try to reenact some of the feel of a traditional matsuri, CJS MATSURI 2008 will have a booth 
with some shrine activities such as "omikuji" and "ema," a place to get your fortune and write your 
wishes, respectively.</p>

<h4>Water Yo-yo Fishing</h4>

<p>Goldfish scooping sounds fun, but I can't raise a goldfish! Well, try the less living alternative, 
Water Yo-yo Fishing. It's just as difficult but with much less responsibility! Plus, you can play way 
more with a water yo-yo than a goldfish. This booth is brought to you by Amnet.</p>

<h4>Arts and Crafts</h4>

<p>Ever wanted to learn how to make origami? Maybe you would like to have your own self-decorated fans
and lanterns. Look no further! Come to the Arts and Crafts booth to let out your artistic side.</p>
