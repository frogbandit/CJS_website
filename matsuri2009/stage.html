<h4>7:30pm - 8:00pm <br>10Tecomai</h4><br><br>
<p>The body goes beyond words.<br><br>

It is neither a full length novel nor a two hour theatrical play.
All is dedicated in a song that does not even last a mere five minutes.
There, lies an almost tragic, yet passionate expression of emotion.<br><br>

Japanese culture and hundreds of other cultures
Our project's foundation is created when these meet.
It is based on a traditional yet contemporary dance form called Yosakoi.<br><br>

While holding a prop called "Naruko" in both hands,
The dancers intensely and dramatically dance as the chanter's cryinstigates the piece.<br><br>

Various expression is created when all of the above is combined.<br><br>

"10tecomai", a Yosakoi Dance Project.
This dance won't stop.
This dance can't be stopped.<br>
<br><br>
To find more about 10tecomai visit their webpage at <a href="http://www.10tecomai.com/">http://www.10tecomai.com/</a>.
