<h4>6:00pm - 6:45pm <br>Uzuhi</h4>
<p>The boisterous but delicate drum beats.<br>
The elegant but brave keyboard sounds.<br>
The rageful and crazy guitar shouts.<br>
The earnest and passionate vocal performances.<br><br>

Notes can't form the power of their music.<br>
Uzuhi's show crosses over races, sexes, ages, and any borders, and it<br>
fascinates, bewitches, and leads anyone to the earnest impression.<br>
What is the real happiness in the world?<br>
The answer should be in their Music.<br><br>

Uzuhi screams from their spirit,<br>
"Music is not what we look at. Music is not what we listen to.<br>
But Music is what we feel!!!"<br>

<h4>7:30pm - 8:00pm <br>10Tecomai</h4>
<p>The body goes beyond words.<br><br>

It is neither a full length novel nor a two hour theatrical play.
All is dedicated in a song that does not even last a mere five minutes.
There, lies an almost tragic, yet passionate expression of emotion.<br><br>

Japanese culture and hundreds of other cultures
Our project's foundation is created when these meet.
It is based on a traditional yet contemporary dance form called Yosakoi.<br><br>

While holding a prop called "Naruko" in both hands,
The dancers intensely and dramatically dance as the chanter's cryinstigates the piece.<br><br>

Various expression is created when all of the above is combined.<br><br>

"10tecomai", a Yosakoi Dance Project.
This dance won't stop.
This dance can't be stopped.<br>
<br><br>
