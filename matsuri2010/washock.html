<h4><a href="http://gogocurryusa.com/">Go Go Curry</a></h4>
<p>Go Go Curry is an authentic fast-food restaurant that serves Japanese curry. The name, "Go Go Curry" comes from the former New York Yankees baseball player, 
Hideki Matsui, whose number was 55 (five in Japanese is "Go" and since there are two fives "Go Go"). The restaurant is thus baseball-themed, and the curry portions 
come in the following sizes - Walk (S), Single (M), Double (L), Triple (XL), and Grand Slam - to reflect the theme. Come taste delicious Japanese curry and restore
