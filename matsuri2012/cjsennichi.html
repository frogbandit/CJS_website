<p>Goldfish scooping is an Edo period tradition often seen at matsuris, and is both simple and fun to play! Using a paper scoop, try to scoop as many goldfish into your bowl as you can. Just be careful; your paper scoop gets weaker the more you dip it in the water.  Scoop as many as possible, and you may win a prize at the end!</p>

<h4>Jinja</h4>
<p>Jinja is a Japanese word for a Shinto shrine.  Matsuri are traditionally associated with the Shinto activity of enshrining a god. Today traditional matsuri are still held on shrine grounds. To experience a traditional matsuri, come to  our jinja booth and participate in some shrine activities such as writing your wishes on an "ema" and receiving your fortune from a "omikuji."</p>

<h4>Water Yo-yo Fishing</h4>
<p>Goldfish scooping sounds fun, but I can't raise a goldfish! Well, try the less living alternative, 
Water Yo-yo Fishing. It's just as difficult but with much less responsibility! Plus, you can play way 
more with a water yo-yo than a goldfish. This booth is brought to you by Amnet.</p>

<h4>Manga</h4>
<p>Ever wanted to be a world-renown mangaka? Well through this big collaborative project
which will last throughout the whole festival, you now can! Everyone can let their
creativity loose by drawing a page following a common storyline, enabling you to hold the
fate of the characters in your hands! We can't wait to see what everyone will create!</p>
