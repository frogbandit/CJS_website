<h4><a href="otafukusauce.com/">Otafuku</a></h4>
<p>Otafuku Sauce Co., Ltd brings Okonomiyaki, a Japanese pancake made from a variety of ingredients. The name "Okonomiyaki" comes from the word "Okonomi," which means "what you like" and "Yaki," which is "grill" in Japanese. Thus, while the batter of the pancake is typically made of flour, water, eggs and shredded cabbage, there are other ingredients that are optional such as meat, shrimp, scallions, kimchi, and mochi that you can put in at your desire. Otafuku Sauce Co., Ltd has a company in the U.S. based in California as well as its main headquarters in Japan. The sauce that is topped on the Okonomiyaki at the end is made from Otafuku Sauce Co., so if you like the sauce, you like Otafuku! The sauce, fortunately, can be found anywhere including our local Asian food store, M2M, so drop by and savor some Okonomiyaki to get the full Matsuri experience!</p>
