<h2 style="text-align:center;">CJS EN'NICHI CORNER</h2>
<p>"En'nichi" is another Japanese word for "festival" or "fair." Come check out some traditional Japanese festival booths run by our very own CJS members and volunteers!</p>


<ul>
<li><h4>Kingyo Sukui</h4>
<p>Kingyo Sukui means "goldfish scooping." The game, which started during the Edo period, is very 
simple. Using a paper scoop, try to scoop as many goldfish into your bowl of water as you can! 
But the longer your scoop is in the water, the weaker it becomes...</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Jinja</h4>
<p>Jinja is the Japanese word for a Shinto shrine. Matsuri are traditionally associated with the 
Shinto activity of enshrining a god. Today, traditional matsuri are still held on shrine grounds. 
To try to reenact some of the feel of a traditional matsuri, CJS MATSURI 2008 will have a booth 
with some shrine activities such as "omikuji" and "ema," a place to get your fortune and write your 
wishes, respectively.</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Sumo Wrestling</h4>

physical competition in the world!</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Whack-a-Mole!</h4>
<p>Everyone knows regular whack-a-mole. You hit annoying moles that stick out of their holes 
with a cushioned hammer. BOOOORING! Play wack-a-mole CJS-style, where moles are living breathing 
evading and fearing! Yes, the moles are us and you and your friends! Get underneath are specially-made

</li>
<li>
<h4>Shateki</h4>
<p>Shateki means shooting targets. Traditionally in Japanese festivals, the guns shoot corks. 
We couldn't afford those guns. So we got marshmallow guns instead! Shoot those marshmallows at 
the targets and get a chance to win big prizes! Of course, we will turn a blind eye if you start 
missing shots into your own mouth...</p>
<img src="ennichi_files/image006.jpg" border="0" height="256" width="385">
</li>
<li>
<h4>Face Painting</h4>
<p>Get one of our great artists to paint things on your face or perhaps take a chance with a 
guy who has absolutely no art skills! Try painting stuff on your own face if you'd like! Whatever!</p>
<img src="ennichi_files/image008.jpg" border="0" height="256" width="386">
</li>
<li>
<h4>Calligraphy</h4>
<p>Do you know what your name looks like in Japanese? Would you like to have it written for you 
in real ink and brush? Head over to this booth and get it done for you for free!</p>
<img src="ennichi_files/image010.jpg" border="0" height="257" width="385">
</li>
<li>
<h4>Wii</h4>
<p>The video game industry has been shook tremendously by Nintendo's Wii. Coupled with the handheld 
system, the DS, Nintendo holds almost all of the world's video game industry by itself! 
Experience Nintendo's all powerful, completely intuitive gaming system, the Wii!</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>Japan Info Booth</h4>
<p>Ever wanted to speak to a real Japanese person? What are they like? What kind of fashion are they into?
What kind of movies do they watch? What do they think of American politics? What kind of music do they 
listen to? Why don't you ask yourself? Come to this booth and talk to ordinary Japanese people on ordinary 
issues. They aren't college professors, they're people like you and me. And you're going to get responses 
from people like you or me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Water Yo-yo Fishing</h4>
<p>Goldfish scooping sounds fun, but I can't raise a goldfish! Well, try the less living alternative, 
Water Yo-yo Fishing. It's just as difficult but with much less responsibility! Plus, you can play way 
more with a water yo-yo than a goldfish. This booth is brought to you by Amnet.</p>
