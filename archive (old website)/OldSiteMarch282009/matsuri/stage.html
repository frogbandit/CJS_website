<h2 style="text-align:center;">STAGE</h2>
<p>In addition to crazy festival booths and authentic Japanese restaurants, CJS MATSURI 2008 also 
prides itself in its spectacular line of stage performances throughout the event! From traditional 
performing arts to just crazy fun game show-style activites, you won't want to miss a thing!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h4>CU Gagaku Ensemble</h4>
<p>Gagaku is a Japanese musical tradition lasting over a thousand years. It's really hard to explain 
what they sound like with writing, so it's best if you just came out and listened for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>CU Japanese Program presents "Musical Senseis"</h4>
<p>Those who have taken a Japanese language class at Columbia University might recognize these performers. 
That's because these performers aren't really performers at all! They are the Japanese program at Columbia 
University's finest teachers! They are going to embarass themselves (or perhaps not!) by singing at 
CJS MATSURI 2008. In addition, they're providing us with a little surprise that even CJS doesn't know about!</p>
