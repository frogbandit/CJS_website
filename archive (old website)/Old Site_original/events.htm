		<pre>This year, CJS presents the quintessential Japanese horror movie,
INFECTION. INFECTION makes blatant use of the most stereotypical
Japanese horror movie setting--the hospital. However, the movie
proves to be refreshingly frightening to even those who may find
the use of this archetypal setting tacky. For those yet unfamiliar 
to the Japanese horror genre, INFECTION will be sure to give you a 
very shocking introduction to the Japanese sense of horror.</pre>
