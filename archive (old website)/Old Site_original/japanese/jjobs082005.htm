<font color="#666666">
 
The Institute for Sensory Research, located in White Plains, New York,
is conducting skin care research with Japanese women 22-47 yrs old. We
are looking for women who have been in this country less than 5 years to
be part of a panel testing well known skin care products, currently
available, and designed specifically for Japanese women.

Training for the panel will run for six weeks. During that period of time,
you will be instructed on washing procedures for your face and forearms.
No previous product testing experience is required.  Your input is vital 
to the manufacturers, and helps to improve the products.

During training you will be asked to come to our facility 2-4 days a week, 
on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Training sessions will 
last approximately 1-1.5 hours. After the completion of the training, you 
will be scheduled to come in 1 hour per day on the same 2-4 days.
