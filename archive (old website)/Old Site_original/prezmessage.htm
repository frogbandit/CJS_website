<h2>&nbsp;Message From the President</h2>
<blockquote><pre>Welcome Class of 2010!

On behalf of the Columbia Japan Society, I would like to welcome
everyone back to the Morningside campus. CJS is thrilled to be back,
and we're re-vamping the club for the 2006-07. Some of our upcoming
events include Brazilian Sushi-Japanese Bossa Nova Night, (formerly
known as Sexy Sushi Night,) UFO-Pink lady dance-offs/instruction, and
maybe an art show or two. I encourage you to join us at any of these
events.

If you are interested on joining the executive board and play a major
role in our events, please feel free to contact any one of our board
members.

I look forward to meeting all of you.

Sincerely,

Teriha Hashimoto
Columbia Japan Society President '06-07</pre></blockquote>
